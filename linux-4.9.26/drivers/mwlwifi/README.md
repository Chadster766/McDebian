# mwlwifi
mac80211 driver for the Marvell 88W8864 802.11ac chip

* How to build mwlwifi with OpenWrt:

10.3.0.17-20160601 had been modified to be built with latest backports package "compat-wireless-2016-01-10" without patches.

a. Modify package/kernel/mwlwifi/Makefile:

PKG_VERSION:=10.3.0.17-20160601
&
PKG_SOURCE_VERSION:=4bb95ba1aeccce506a95499b49b9b844ecfae8a1

b. Rename package/kernel/mwlwifi/patches to package/kernel/mwlwifi/patches.tmp

c. make package/kernel/mwlwifi/clean

d. make V=s (-jx)

* After driver 10.3.0.17-20160603, [MAX-MPDU-7991] should be removed from vht_capab command of hostapd.

* Hostpad must include following commit for 160 MHz operation:

    VHT: Add an interoperability workaround for 80+80 and 160 MHz channels
 
    Number of deployed 80 MHz capable VHT stations that do not support 80+80
    and 160 MHz bandwidths seem to misbehave when trying to connect to an AP
    that advertises 80+80 or 160 MHz channel bandwidth in the VHT Operation
    element. To avoid such issues with deployed devices, modify the design
    based on newly proposed IEEE 802.11 standard changes.
 
    This allows poorly implemented VHT 80 MHz stations to connect with the
    AP in 80 MHz mode. 80+80 and 160 MHz capable stations need to support
    the new workaround mechanism to allow full bandwidth to be used.
    However, there are more or less no impacted station with 80+80/160
    capability deployed.

    Note: After hostapd package 2016-06-15, this commit is already included.

* In order to let STA mode to support 160 MHz operation, mac80211 package should be 2016-10-08 or later.
* WiFi device does not use HT rates when using TKIP as the encryption cipher.
 Â If you want to have good performance, please use AES only.
* DTS parameters for mwlwifi driver (pcie@X,0):

  marvell,2ghz = <0>; => Disable 2g band.
  marvell,5ghz = <0>; => Disable 5g band.

  marvell,chainmask = <4 4>; => Specify antenna number, default is 4x4. For WRT1200AC, you must set these values to 2x2.

  marvell,powertable => Specify external power table. If your device needs external power table, you must provide the power table via this parameter, otherwise the Tx power will be pretty low.

root@lede:/# cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/mwlwifi/info

power table loaded from dts: no

  => If it is "no", it does not allow you to load external power table (for new device).

  => If it is "yes", you must provide power table in DTS file (for old device).
