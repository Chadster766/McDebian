##Warning!

Flashing the McDebian firmware must only be done using a USB to Serial cable. 

##Notice: For rootfs USB Flash drives I recommend using Corsair or Sandisk because Wear Leveling is built into the hardware. I also recommend using a spinning disk external drive or any other type of disk that has built in wear leveling.
