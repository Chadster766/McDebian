I've managed to get Debian Jessie to run successfully on a WRT1900AC V2.

The below link outlines how I did it:

I'm hoping this will spur activity and development to improve the SMB potential of the new Linksys WRT series for the advanced IT sector.

What are your thoughts on the subject of having a full blown Debian OS on high powered SMB wireless routers?

I'm also looking for firewall, routing and security suggestions along with system configurations to speed up development of this Debian WRT system.

I also have many of these router deployed in commercial production environments but I feel I'm not taking advantage of their full potential.
