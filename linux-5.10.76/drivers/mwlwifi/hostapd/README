    VHT: Add an interoperability workaround for 80+80 and 160 MHz channels

    Number of deployed 80 MHz capable VHT stations that do not support 80+80
    and 160 MHz bandwidths seem to misbehave when trying to connect to an AP
    that advertises 80+80 or 160 MHz channel bandwidth in the VHT Operation
    element. To avoid such issues with deployed devices, modify the design
    based on newly proposed IEEE 802.11 standard changes.

    This allows poorly implemented VHT 80 MHz stations to connect with the
    AP in 80 MHz mode. 80+80 and 160 MHz capable stations need to support
    the new workaround mechanism to allow full bandwidth to be used.
    However, there are more or less no impacted station with 80+80/160
    capability deployed.
